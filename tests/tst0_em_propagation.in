# ---------------------------------------------

# sim_units: normalisation units for the input data
#            it is used only in the input data & log file
#            codes outputs are always in "normalised" units
#            wavelength = input data are in wavelength-related units
#            normalized = input data are put in code (relativistic) units
#

# dim: Geometry of the simulation
#      1d3v = cartesian grid with 1d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2d3v = cartesian grid with 2d in space + 3d in velocity
#      3d3v = cartesian grid with 3d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2drz = cylindrical (r,z) grid with 3d3v particles

# SIMULATION TIME
# res_time: temporal resolution (integer = number of timeâˆ’steps within one normalization period)
# sim_time: duration of the simulation in units of the normalization period 
#

# ELECTROMAGNETIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
# bc_em_type_long/trans : boundary conditions used for EM fields

# LASER PROPERTIES
#
# for each laser define:
# a0: maximum amplitude of the laser electric field (in units of the normalization field)
# angle: angle (in degree) at which the laser enters the simulation box
# delta: polarization parameter, (0:y) (1:z) (0.707106781:circ)
# time_profile: string defining the time profile
# double_params: vector of real parameters used by the different time-profiles
