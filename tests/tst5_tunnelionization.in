# sim_units: normalisation units for the input data
#            it is used only in the input data & log file
#            codes outputs are always in "normalised" units

#            normalized = input data are put in code (relativistic) units
#
sim_units = wavelength

# dim: Geometry of the simulation
#      1d3v = cartesian grid with 1d in space + 3d in velocity
#      2d3v = cartesian grid with 2d in space + 3d in velocity

# SIMULATION TIME 
# either use the resolution (res_time) or time-step (timestep)

# SIMULATION BOX : for all space directions (in 2D & 3D use vector of doubles)
# either use the resolution (res_space) or cell-length (cell_length)

# res_space   : spatial resolution 
# sim_length  : length of the simulation 
# cell_length : cell-length

#                         periodic      = periodic BC (using MPI topology)
