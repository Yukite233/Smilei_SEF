Welcome
#######

The Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code :program:`Smilei` is an **open-source project**
developed by the PIC community at the *Plateau de Saclay* to support the development
of the Apollon laser within the `CILEX <http://cilexsaclay.fr>`_ framework.

:program:`Smilei` stands for **Simulating Matter Irradiated by Light at Extreme
Intensies**, and is developed through a collaboration between various teams at
`Ecole Polytechnique <https://www.polytechnique.edu/fr/centre-de-recherche>`_,
at the `CEA/Saclay <http://www-centre-saclay.cea.fr/en>`_ and with strong support
from the `Maison de la Simulation <http://www.maisondelasimulation.fr/>`_ and
`IDRIS <http://www.idris.fr/>`_ on the numerical side.
