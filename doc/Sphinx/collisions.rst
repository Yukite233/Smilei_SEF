Binary collisions
-----------------


Relativistic binary collisions between particles have been implemented in
:program:`Smilei` with the same scheme as the one developed for the
code :program:`Calder`. The following references describe the physics
and numerics of this implementation.

| [Perez2012]_ gives an overview of the technique.
| [Nanbu1997]_ and [Nanbu1998]_ give the original technique from which [Perez2012]_ was developed.
| [Sentoku2008]_, [Lee1984]_ and [Frankel1979]_ provide additional information.

Please refer to :ref:`that doc <Collisions>` for an explanation of how to add collisions in the namelist file.

The binary collision scheme
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Collisions are calculated at each timestep.

For each collision block (given in the input file):
  
  For each particle cluster:
    
    If *intra-collisions*:
      
      | Create one array of indices pointing to all particles of the species group.
      | Shuffle the array.
      | Split the array in two halves.
    
    If *inter-collisions*:
      
      | Create two arrays of indices pointing to all particles of each species group.
      | Shuffle the largest array. The other array is not shuffled.
      | => The two resulting arrays represent pairs of particles (see algorithm in [Nanbu1998]_).
    
    Calculate a few intermediate quantities:
      
      | Particle density :math:`n_1` of group 1.
      | Particle density :math:`n_2`  of group 2.
      | *Crossed* particle density :math:`n_{12}` (see [Perez2012]_).
      | Other constants.
    
    For each pair of particles:
    
      | Calculate the momenta in the center-of-mass (COM) frame.
      | Calculate the coulomb log if requested (see [Perez2012]_).
      | Calculate the parameter :math:`s` and its correction at low temperature (see [Perez2012]_).
      | Pick the deflection angle (see [Nanbu1997]_).
      | Deflect particles in the COM frame and go back to the laboratory frame.

Test cases
^^^^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: 1. Beam relaxation

An electron beam with narrow energy spread enters an ion background with :math:`T_i=10` eV.
The ions are of very small mass :math:`m_i=10 m_e` to speed-up the calculation.
Only e-i collisions are calculated.
The beam gets strong isotropization => the average velocity relaxes to zero.

Three figures show the time-evolution of the longitudinal :math:`\left<v_\|\right>`
and transverse velocity :math:`\sqrt{\left<v_\perp^2\right>}`

* :numref:`beam1` : initial velocity = 0.05, ion charge = 1
* :numref:`beam2` : initial velocity = 0.01, ion charge = 1
* :numref:`beam3` : initial velocity = 0.01, ion charge = 3

Each of these figures show 3 different blue and red curves which correspond to different
ratios of particle weights: 0.1, 1, and 10.

.. _beam1:

.. figure:: _static/beam_relaxation123.png
  :width: 12cm
  
  Relaxation of an electron beam. Initial velocity = 0.05, ion charge = 1.
  
.. _beam2:

.. figure:: _static/beam_relaxation456.png
  :width: 12cm
  
  Relaxation of an electron beam. Initial velocity = 0.01, ion charge = 1.

.. _beam3:

.. figure:: _static/beam_relaxation789.png
  :width: 12cm
  
  Relaxation of an electron beam. Initial velocity = 0.01, ion charge = 3.


The black lines correspond to the theoretical rates taken from the NRL formulary:

.. math::
  
  \nu_\| = -\left(1+\frac{m_e}{m_i}\right)\nu_0
  \quad\textrm{and}\quad
  \nu_\perp = 2\;\nu_0
  \quad\textrm{where}\quad
  \nu_0=\frac{e^4\,Z^{\star 2}\,n_i\,\ln\Lambda } { 4 \pi \epsilon_0^2 \,m_e^2\,v_e^3 }


The distribution is quickly non-Maxwellian so that theory is valid only at the beginning.


.. rubric:: 2. Thermalization

A population of electrons has a different temperature from that of the ion population.
Through e-i collisions, the two temperatures become equal.
The ions are of very small mass :math:`m_i=10 m_e` to speed-up the calculation.
Three cases are simulated, corresponding to different ratios of weights: 0.2, 1 and 5.
They are plotted in :numref:`thermalization`.

.. _thermalization:

.. figure:: _static/thermalisation_ei123.png
  :width: 9cm
  
  Thermalization between two species.

The black lines correspond to the theoretical rates taken from the NRL formulary:

.. math::
  
  \nu_\epsilon=\frac{e^4\,Z^{\star 2} \sqrt{m_em_i}\,n_i\,\ln\Lambda }
  { 8 \epsilon_0^2 \,\left(m_eT_e+m_iT_i\right)^{3/2} }




.. rubric:: 3. Temperature isotropization

Electrons have a longitudinal temperature different from their transverse temperature.
They collide only with themselves (intra-collisions) and the anisotropy disappears
as shown in :numref:`temperature_isotropization`.

.. _temperature_isotropization:

.. figure:: _static/temperature_isotropization1.png
  :width: 10cm
  
  Temperature isotropization of an electron population.

The black lines correspond to the theoretical rates taken from the NRL formulary:

.. math::
  
  \nu_T=\frac{e^4 \,n_e\,\ln\Lambda } { 8\pi^{3/2} \epsilon_0^2 \,m_e^{1/2}T_\|^{3/2} }
  A^{-2} \left[-3+(3-A)\frac{\rm{arctanh}(\sqrt{A})}{\sqrt{A}}\right]
  \quad \rm{where}\quad A=1-\frac{T_\perp}{T_\|}



.. rubric:: 4. Maxwellianization

Electrons start with zero temperature along :math:`y` and :math:`z`.
Their velocity distribution along :math:`x` is rectangular.
They collide only with themselves and the rectangle becomes a maxwellian 
as shown in :numref:`maxwellianization`.

.. _maxwellianization:

.. figure:: _static/Maxwellianization1.png
  :width: 10cm
  
  Maxwellianization of an electron population.
  Each blue curve is the distribution at a given time.
  The red curve is an example of a gaussian function.



.. rubric:: 5. Stopping power

Test electrons (very low density) collide with background electrons of density
:math:`10\,n_c` and :math:`T_e=5` keV.
Depending on their initial velocity, they are slowed down at different rates,
as shown in :numref:`stoppingpower`.

.. _stoppingpower:

.. figure:: _static/Stopping_power123.png
  :width: 10cm
  
  Stopping power of test electrons into a background electron population.
  Each point is one simulation. The black line is Frankel's theory [Frankel1979]_.


.. rubric:: 6. Conductivity

Solid-density Cu is simulated at different temperatures (e-i equilibrium) with only
e-i collisions. An electric field of :math:`E=3.2` GV/m (0.001 in code units) is
applied using two charged layers on each side of the solid Cu.
The electron velocity increases until a limit value :math:`v_f`.
The resulting conductivity :math:`\sigma=en_ev_f/E` is compared in
:numref:`conductivity` to the models in [Lee1984]_ and [Perez2012]_.

.. _conductivity:

.. figure:: _static/conductivity.png
  :width: 10cm
  
  Conductivity of colid-density copper. Each point is one simulation.

Collisions debugging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the parameter ``debug_every`` in a ``Collisions()`` group (see :ref:`Collisions`)
will create a file with info about these collisions.
These information are stored in the files "Collisions0.h5", "Collisions1.h5", etc.

The *hdf5* files are structured as follows:
  One HDF5 file contains several groups called ``"t********"`` where ``"********"``
  is the timestep. Each of these groups contains several arrays, which represent
  quantities *vs.* space.

The available arrays are:

  * ``s``: defined in [Perez2012]_: :math:`s=N\left<\theta^2\right>`, where :math:`N` is
    the typical number of real collisions during a timestep, and
    :math:`\left<\theta^2\right>` is the average square deviation of individual 
    real collisions. This quantity somewhat represents the typical amount of angular
    deflection accumulated during one timestep.
    **It is recommended that** :math:`s<1` **in order to have realistic collisions.**
  * ``coulomb_log``: average Coulomb logarithm.
  * ``debyelength``: Debye length (not provided if all Coulomb logs are manually defined).

The arrays are all one-dimensional: they are in the same order as the *clusters* or *patches*.
You have to figure out by yourself how to convert that to (x, y, z) !
