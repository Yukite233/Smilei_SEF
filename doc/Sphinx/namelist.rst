Namelist syntax
---------------

In :program:`Smilei`, the input file (*namelist*) is written in the *python* language.
It is thus recommended to know the basics of *python*.

To create a namelist, we suggest you copy one existing file in the folder *benchmarks*.
All namelists have the extension *.py*.

----

General rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The namelist must define variables that :program:`Smilei` will understand.
  For instance, ``timestep = 0.01``.
  All *python* operations are valid. For instance: ``timestep = 40*0.0001``.

* The *python* syntax requires special indentation of each line.
  You begin with no indentation, but you have to **add four spaces at the
  beginning of lines inside a group**, and so on.
  For instance::
    
    if a == 0:
        timestep = 0.1
        if b == 1:
            timestep = 0.2
    else:
        timestep = 0.3
  

* You will need to use *lists*, which are series of things in *python*,
  defined between brackets ``[]`` and separated by commas.
  For example, ``mean_velocity = [0., 1.1, 3.]``.

* You are free to import any *python* package into the namelist.
  For instance, you may obtain :math:`\pi` using ``from math import pi``.

* **Important note**: :program:`Smilei` normalizes lengths and times to arbitrary values
  :math:`L_0` and :math:`T_0 = L_0/c`.
  All lengths and times defined in the namelist are given in units of
  :math:`L_0` and :math:`T_0`.

----

Stop and restart
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. py:data:: dump_step 

  :default: 0

  The number of timesteps between each dump of the full simulation.
  If ``0``, no dump is done.
  
.. py:data:: dump_minutes 

  :default: 0.

  The number of minutes between each dump of the full simulation (combines with ``dump_step``).
  If ``0.``, no dump is done.

.. py:data:: exit_after_dump

  :default: ``True``

  If ``True``, the code stops after the dump.

.. py:data:: restart

  :default: ``False``

  If ``True``, :program:`Smilei` finds the last dump file and loads the corresponding simulation.
  If the dump file is not found, an error is raised.

  	initPosition_type = "regular",
  	initMomentum_type = "maxwell-juettner",
  	n_part_per_cell = 1000,

External fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
External fields can be applied using a ``ExtField()`` block, for instance::

  ExtField(
      field = "Ex",
      profile = constant(0.01, xvacuum=0.1)
  )

All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:


.. py:data:: field
  
  The name of the field: ``"Ex"``, ``"Ey"``, ``"Ez"``, ``"Bx"``, ``"By"`` or ``"Bz"``.

.. py:data:: profile
  
  :type: float or *python* function (see section :ref:`profiles`)
  
  The initial spatial profile of the applied field.
  The units are the natural normalization units for fields,
  i.e., :math:`B_0=m_e /(eT_0)` for magnetic fields, and :math:`E_0=m_e c/(eT_0)` for electric fields.


----

.. _profiles:

Spatial profiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several quantities require the input of a spatial profile:

* The average particle charge.
* The charge density or number density.
* The drift velocity.
* The temperature (only for distributions which require a temperature value).
* The number of particles per cell.
* Any external field.

There are many ways to define a profile.

1. Constant profiles

  * ``Species( ... , charge = -3., ... )`` defines a species with charge :math:`Z^\star=3`.
  
  * ``Species( ... , nb_density = 10., ... )`` defines a species with density :math:`10\,n_c`.
    You can choose ``nb_density`` (*number density*) or ``charge_density``
  
  * ``Species( ... , mean_velocity = [0.05, 0., 0.], ... )`` defines a species
    with drift velocity :math:`v_x = 0.05\,c` over the whole box.
  
  * ``Species(..., initMomentum_type="maxwell-juettner", temperature=[1e-5], ...)`` defines
    a species with a Maxwell-JÃ¼ttner distribution of temperature :math:`T = 10^{-5}\,m_ec^2` over the whole box.
    Note that the temperature may be anisotropic: ``temperature=[1e-5, 2e-5, 2e-5]``.
  
  * ``Species( ... , n_part_per_cell = 10., ... )`` defines a species with 10 particles per cell.
  
  * ``ExtField( field="Bx", profile=0.1 )`` defines a constant external field :math:`B_x = 0.1 B_0`.
  

2. *Python* profiles

  Any *python* function can be a profile. You must have basic *python* knowledge to build these functions.
  
  Examples::
  
    def f(x):
        if x<1.: return 0.
        else: return 1.
  
  .. code-block:: python
  
    def f(x,y):    # two variables for 2D simulation
        import math
        twoPI = 2.* math.pi
        return math.cos(  twoPI * x/3.2 )
  
  .. code-block:: python
    
    f = lambda x: x**2 - 1
  
..

  Once the function is created, you have to include it in the block you want:
  
  * ``Species( ... , charge = f, ... )``
  
  * ``Species( ... , nb_density = f, ... )``
  
  * ``Species( ... , mean_velocity = [f, f, f], ... )``
  
  * ``Species( ... , temperature = [f, f, f], ... )``
  
  * ``Species( ... , n_part_per_cell = f, ... )``
  
  * ``ExtField( ... , profile = f, ... )``


3. Built-in *python* functions

  :program:`Smilei` provides some *python* functions to help you build your profiles.
  
  .. py:function:: constant(value, xvacuum=0., yvacuum=0.)
  
    :param value: the magnitude
    :param xvacuum: vacuum region before the start of the profile.
  
  .. py:function:: trapezoidal(max, \
            xvacuum=0., xplateau=None, xslope1=0., xslope2=0., \
            yvacuum=0., yplateau=None, yslope1=0., yslope2=0. )
  
    :param max: maximum value
    :param xvacuum: empty length before the ramp up
    :param xplateau: length of the plateau (default is :py:data:`sim_length` :math:`-` ``xvacuum``)
    :param xslope1: length of the ramp up
    :param xslope2: length of the ramp down
  
  .. py:function:: gaussian(max, \
     xvacuum=0., xlength=None, xfwhm=None, xcenter=None, xorder=2, \
     yvacuum=0., ylength=None, yfwhm=None, ycenter=None, yorder=2 )
  
    :param max: maximum value
    :param xvacuum: empty length before starting the profile
    :param xlength:  length of the profile (default is :py:data:`sim_length` :math:`-` ``xvacuum``)
    :param xfwhm: gaussian FWHM (default is ``xlength/3.``)
    :param xcenter: gaussian center position (default is in the middle of ``xlength``)
    :param xorder: order of the gaussian.
    :note: If ``yorder`` equals 0, then the profile is constant over :math:`y`.
  
  .. py:function:: polygonal( xpoints=[], xvalues=[] )
  
    :param xpoints: list of the positions of the points
    :param xvalues: list of the values of the profile at each point
  
  .. py:function:: cosine( base, amplitude=1., \
           xvacuum=0., xlength=None, phi=0., xnumber=1 )
  
    :param base: offset of the profile value
    :param amplitude: amplitude of the cosine
    :param xvacuum: empty length before starting the profile
    :param xlength: length of the profile (default is :py:data:`sim_length` :math:`-` ``xvacuum``)
    :param phi: phase offset`
    :param xnumber: number of periods within ``xlength``
  
  **Example**::
    
    Species( ... ,
        density = gaussian(10., xfwhm=0.3, xcenter=0.8),
    ... )

.. _Collisions:

Collisions
^^^^^^^^^^

To have binary collisions in :program:`Smilei`,
add one or several ``Collisions()`` block in the namelist,
for instance::

  Collisions(
  	species1 = ["electrons1",  "electrons2"],
  	species2 = ["ions1"],
  	coulomb_log = 5.
  )


All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: species1
             species2
  
  :type: list of strings
  
  List of species names (see :py:data:`species_type`).
  
  The collisions will occur between
    1. all species under the list ``species1``
    2. and all species under the group ``species2``
  
  For instance, to have collisions between ``electrons1`` and ``ions1`` , use::
    
    species1 = ["electrons1"], species2 = ["ions1"]

..

  Other example, to collide all electrons with ions::
    
    species1 = ["electrons1", "electrons2"], species2 = ["ions"]

..

  **WARNING: this does not make** ``electrons1`` **collide with** ``electrons2``.
  
  The two groups of species have to be *completely different* OR *exactly equal*.
  In other words, if ``species1`` is not equal to ``species2``,
  then they cannot have any common species.
  If the two groups are exactly equal, we call this situation **intra-collisions**.


.. py:data:: coulomb_log
  
  :default: 0.
  
  The Coulomb logarithm.
  
  * If :math:`= 0`, the Coulomb logarithm is automatically computed for each collision.
  * If :math:`> 0`, the Coulomb logarithm is equal to this value.


.. py:data:: debug_every
  
  :default: 0
  
  | Number of timesteps between each output of information about collisions.
  | If 0, there will be no outputs.


For more details about the collision scheme in :program:`Smilei`, see :doc:`collisions`


----

.. _DiagScalar:

*Scalars* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:program:`Smilei` can collect various scalar data, such as total particle energy, total field energy, etc.
This is done by including the block ``DiagScalar()`` in the namelist, for instance::

  DiagScalar( every = 10 ,
              time_range = [0.1, 1.],
              vars = ["Utot", "Ukin", "Uelm"]
            )

All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: every
  
  Number of timesteps between each output.


.. py:data:: time_range
  
  :default: ``[]``
  
  | List of two values: minimum and maximum times that will be used.
  | Omit this argument to include all times.


.. py:data:: precision
  
  :default: 10
  
  Number of digits of the outputs.

.. py:data:: vars
  
  :default: ``[]``
  
  | List of scalars that will be actually output. Note that all scalars are computed anyways.
  | Omit this argument to include all scalars.

  The number of timesteps between each output of the instantaneous fields.

.. py:data:: avgfieldDump_every
  
  The number of timesteps between each output of the time-averaged fields.

.. py:data:: ntime_step_avg
  
  The number of timesteps for time-averaging.

.. py:data:: fieldsToDump
  
  :default: ``[]``
  
  List of field names that are saved. By default, they all are.

.. _DiagProbe:

*Probe* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fields from the previous section are taken at the PIC grid locations,
but it is also possible to obtain the fields at arbitrary locations.
These are called *probes*.

A probe interpolates the fields at either one point (0-D),
several points arranged in a line (1-D) or several points arranged in a mesh (2-D).

To add one probe diagnostic, include the block ``DiagProbe()`` in the namelist.
There are several ways to do it:

**1. For only one point (zero-dimensional probe)**
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every      = ... , # a number
        pos        = [x0, y0, z0]
    )
  
  * ``every`` is the number of timesteps between each output.
  * ``x0 [, y0 [, z0]]`` is the position of the point where to interpolate the fields.
  
  **Note**: ``y0`` (or ``z0``) should only be used in the case of a 2-D (or 3-D) simulation.


**2. For a series of points arranged in a line (one-dimensional probe)**
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every      = ... , # a number
        pos        = [x0, y0, z0],
        pos_first  = [x1, y1, z1],
        number     = [n1]
    )
  
  * ``x0 [, y0 [, z0]]`` is the position of the starting point of the line.
  * ``x1 [, y1 [, z1]]`` is the position of the ending point of the line.
  * ``n1`` is the number of points along this line.

**3. For a series of points arranged in a mesh (two-dimensional probe)**
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every      = ... , # a number
        pos        = [x0, y0, z0],
        pos_first  = [x1, y1, z1],
        pos_second = [x2, y2, z2],
        number     = [n1, n2]
    )
  
  In this case, the three points define three vertices of a paralellogram.


**Notes**

* There is an extra argument ``fields``, a list of fields among ``"Ex"``, ``"Ey"``, ``"Ez"``,
  ``"Bx"``, ``"By"``, ``"Bz"``, ``"Jx"``, ``"Jy"``, ``"Jz"`` and ``"Rho"``. Only these
  fields will be saved. Use, for example, ``fields=["Bz"]`` if you are only interested
  in :math:`B_z`. Note that it does NOT speed up calculation much, but it saves disk space.
* The dimension of the probe is decided only by the instruction ``number``:
  without it, the probe is 0-D, with ``number = [n1]``, the probe is 1-D,
  and with ``number =  [n1, n2]``, the probe is 2-D.
* You can have several probes in the input file.

**Examples of probe diagnostics**

* 0-D probe in 1-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos   = [1.2]
    )

* 1-D probe in 1-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos       = [1.2],
        pos_first = [5.6],
        number    = [100]
    )

* 1-D probe in 2-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos       = [1.2,  4.],
        pos_first = [5.6,  4.],
        number    = [100]
    )

* 2-D probe in 2-D simulation
  ::
    
    DiagProbe(
        every = 1,
        pos        = [0. ,   0.],
        pos_first  = [10. ,  0.],
        pos_second = [0.,    10.],
        number     = [100,   100]
    )

.. _DiagParticles:

*Particle* diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *particle diagnostic* collects data from the macro-particles and processes them during runtime.
It does not provide information on individual particles: instead, it produces
**averaged quantities** like the particle density, currents, etc.

The data may be collected from one or several particle species.

The data is discretized inside a "grid" chosen by the user. This grid may be of any dimension.

Examples:

* 1-dimensional grid along the position :math:`x` (gives density variation along :math:`x`)
* 2-dimensional grid along positions :math:`x` and :math:`y` (gives density map)
* 1-dimensional grid along the velocity :math:`v_x` (gives the velocity distribution)
* 2-dimensional grid along position :math:`x` and momentum :math:`p_x` (gives the phase-space)
* 1-dimensional grid along the kinetic energy :math:`E_\mathrm{kin}` (gives the energy distribution)
* 3-dimensional grid along :math:`x`, :math:`y` and :math:`E_\mathrm{kin}` (gives the density map for several energies)
* 1-dimensional grid along the charge :math:`Z^\star` (gives the charge distribution)

Each dimension of the grid is called "axis".

You can add a particle diagnostic by including a block ``DiagParticles()`` in the namelist,
for instance::
  
  DiagParticles(
  	output = "density",
  	every = 5,
  	time_average = 1,
  	species = ["electrons1", "electrons2"],
  	axes = [
  		["x", 0., 10, 100],
  		["ekin", 0.1, 100, 1000, "logscale", "edge_inclusive"]
  	]
  )

All the possible variables inside this block are explained here:

.. py:data:: output

  determines the data that is summed in each cell of the grid:
  
  * with ``"density"``, the weights are summed.
  * with ``"charge_density"``, the weights :math:`\times` charge are summed.
  * with ``"current_density_x"``, the weights :math:`\times` charge :math:`\times\; v_x` are summed (same with :math:`y` and :math:`z`).
  * with ``"p_density"``, the weights :math:`\times\; p` are summed (same with :math:`px`, :math:`py` and :math:`pz`)


.. py:data:: every
  
  The number of time-steps between each output.


.. py:data:: time_average
  
  The number of time-steps during which the data is averaged before output.


.. py:data:: species
  
  A list of the names of one or several species (see :py:data:`species_type`).


.. py:data:: axes
  
  A list of "axes" that define the grid.
  
  Syntax of one axis: ``[type, min, max, nsteps, "logscale", "edge_inclusive"]``
  
  * ``type`` is one of ``"x"``, ``"y"``, ``"z"``, ``"px"``, ``"py"``, ``"pz"``, ``"p"``,
    ``"gamma"``, ``"ekin"``, ``"vx"``, ``"vy"``, ``"vz"``, ``"v"`` or ``"charge"``.
  * The axis is discretized for ``type`` from ``min`` to ``max`` in ``nsteps`` bins.
  * The optional keyword ``logscale`` sets the axis scale to logarithmic instead of linear.
  * The optional keyword ``edge_inclusive`` includes the particles outside the range
    [``min``, ``max``] into the extrema bins.
  
  There may be as many axes as wanted in one ``DiagParticles( ... )`` block.

    )

* :math:`x`-:math:`y` density maps for three bands of energy: :math:`[0,1]`, :math:`[1,2]`, :math:`[2,\infty]`.
